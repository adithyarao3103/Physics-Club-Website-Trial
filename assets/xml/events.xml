		<name>Research Opportunities in Physics</name>
		<date>19 June 2021</date>
		<poster>150621</poster>
		<descr>It's that time of the year when we sit back and start planning for the upcoming academic year. Internship through portals or emailing professors? When and where to apply? CV? Writing a good SOP? We know it's very easy to get caught up in these questions and that's exactly why we encourage you to attend the webinar on 'Research Opportunities in Physics'.<br>Suraj Singh, Nidhi Mehandiratta and Devanshu Sharma will help you navigate through various opportunities available for Physics students. </descr>

		<name>N-Body Simulation</name>
		<date>27-28 March 2021</date>
		<poster>270321</poster>
		<descr>We are back with another workshop! This time, a 2 day certified workshop on N-body simulation.An N-body simulation approximates the motion of particles, often specifically particles that interact with one another through some type of physical forces. The types of particles that can be simulated using N-body methods range from celestial bodies to individual atoms in a gas cloud. Exciting, isn't it?!Join us on 27th March (3pm) and 28th March(9am) with Dr. Prakash Sarkar.<br>Prior knowledge of programming in C and familiarity with Numerical Methods will certainly help. Due to limited availability of seats, we ask you to fill the registration form carefully.</descr>

		<name>A logico-linguistic inquiry into the foundations of physics</name>
		<date>7 January 2021</date>
		<poster>070121</poster>
		<descr>Are physical dimension and number distinct concepts? If yes, then on what logical grounds, does the physicist perform dimensional analysis by considering physical dimensions as numbers? If no, then why does the physicist use the words like mass, length, etc. instead of writing just numbers? If this question made you question the foundation of physics, be sure to join our first Science Sabha talk of 2021.Dr. Abhishek Majhi of Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata will take up such questions in his talk on ' A logico-linguistic inquiry into the foundations of physics'.</descr>

		<name>Piercing the invisible cosmos | Detecting the undetectable</name>
		<date>18 October 2019</date>
		<poster>181019</poster>
		<descr>Detecting the undetectable will be an Introduction to experimental high energy physics. How do we test and validate the theories? Experimental High energy physics is a way to study the nature and behaviour of the elementary particles of the universe and an attempt to solve some of the unsolved mysteries of the universe.<br>Piercing the Invisible cosmos will cover up Radio astronomy  With radio astronomy, we study astronomical phenomena that are often invisible or hidden in other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. From detecting the black hole image to predicting the gravitational wave events, radio astronomy is key behind such groundbreaking discoveries.</descr>

		<name>An approach to the Theory Of Everything</name>
		<date>17 October 2019</date>
		<poster>171019</poster>
		<descr>Our history of understanding physical laws has been a history of unification. The first example is probably Newton's gravitational law which says that the equation used for describing the force that a planet exerts on another planet is the same for for that on an apple. Then came up unified fields like the Quantumelectrodynamics ... and so on and so forth. So gear up for the talk by Tiyasa Kar on 17 October 2019 where you will be taken for a ride to 'Theory of Everything'.</descr>
