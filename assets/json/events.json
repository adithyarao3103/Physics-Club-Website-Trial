		"descr":"It's that time of the year when we sit back and start planning for the upcoming academic year. Internship through portals or emailing professors? When and where to apply? CV? Writing a good SOP? We know it's very easy to get caught up in these questions and that's exactly why we encourage you to attend the webinar on 'Research Opportunities in Physics'.<br>Suraj Singh, Nidhi Mehandiratta and Devanshu Sharma will help you navigate through various opportunities available for Physics students.

		{"name":"N-Body Simulation", 
		"date":"27-28 March 2021", 
		"poster":"270321", 
		"descr":"We are back with another workshop! This time, a 2 day certified workshop on N-body simulation.An N-body simulation approximates the motion of particles, often specifically particles that interact with one another through some type of physical forces. The types of particles that can be simulated using N-body methods range from celestial bodies to individual atoms in a gas cloud. Exciting, isn't it?!Join us on 27th March (3pm) and 28th March(9am) with Dr. Prakash Sarkar.<br>Prior knowledge of programming in C and familiarity with Numerical Methods will certainly help.",

		{"name":"A logico-linguistic inquiry into the foundations of physics",
		"date":"7 January 2021",
		"poster":"070121",
		"descr":"Are physical dimension and number distinct concepts? If yes, then on what logical grounds, does the physicist perform dimensional analysis by considering physical dimensions as numbers? If no, then why does the physicist use the words like mass, length, etc. instead of writing just numbers? If this question made you question the foundation of physics, be sure to join our first Science Sabha talk of 2021.Dr. Abhishek Majhi of Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata will take up such questions in his talk on ' A logico-linguistic inquiry into the foundations of physics'.",

		"date":"23 December 2020",
		"poster":"231220",
		"descr":"We've all either seen or done the baking soda volcano project in school science fairs. Let's take that experimental spirit and notch it up to next level. Being an experimental physicist that is. This Wednesday evening, join us with Dr. Akashrup Banerjee where he'll talk about developing an experimental acumen and preparing oneself to be an experimentalist.",
