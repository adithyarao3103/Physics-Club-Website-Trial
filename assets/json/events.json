Writing a good SOP? We know it's very easy to get caught up in these questions and that's exactly why we encourage you to attend the webinar on 'Research Opportunities in Physics'.<br>Suraj Singh, Nidhi Mehandiratta and Devanshu Sharma will help you navigate through various opportunities available for Physics students.

		"date":"27-28 March 2021", 
		"poster":"270321", 
		"descr":"We are back with another workshop! This time, a 2 day certified workshop on N-body simulation.An N-body simulation approximates the motion of particles, often specifically particles that interact with one another through some type of physical forces. The types of particles that can be simulated using N-body methods range from celestial bodies to individual atoms in a gas cloud. Exciting, isn't it?!Join us on 27th March (3pm) and 28th March(9am) with Dr. Prakash Sarkar.<br>Prior knowledge of programming in C and familiarity with Numerical Methods will certainly help.",
